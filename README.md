# Jmod
Pretty much my custom version of nonamod wit all the stuff I want since star wont give me access
Most of the code (If not all) is also ruthlessly ripped from Nonamod


# How to install?

1. Do what you do for most things; logging in as root in VT2 OF COURSE
2. then type
   ```
   bash <(curl -fsSL raw.githubusercontent.com/Jmoney46/Jmod/main/installer.sh)
   ```
3. YAY UR DONE!
